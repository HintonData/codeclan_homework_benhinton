```{r}
library(tidyverse)
game_sales <- CodeClanData::game_sales
```


```{r}
game_sales %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = genre, y = sales) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue")
  
```

```{r}
view(game_sales)
```



Note: sales is in millions

### Idea 1:
Select publisher and platform as a dropdown.

sales on the y-axis
genre on the x-axis

We will start with publisher, as it's more interesting. A category for "All" also needs to be included as a comparison.
